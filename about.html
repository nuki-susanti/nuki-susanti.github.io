    Hi, I’m Nuki. I’m a motivated data analyst who enjoys digging into data and turning it into useful insights. Having gone through a career in several roles; being field drilling engineer, academic researcher and EHS (Environment Health & Safety) consultant, I'm always amazed how far we get with the help of data.
</p>
    My past career taught me to how define a problem and come up with systematic problem solving. Data is always my main weapon to back up the crafted solutions. Now, I’m excited to expand my knowledge and skills to help customers make the best use of their data to achieve goals, particularly in creating safe, environmental-compliant and sustainable business.

<h4><b>How did I fall in love with data?</b></h4>
<p>
    It is said that data is the new oil. Unfortunately, we're not living in an ideal world where data is always in ready-to-use package. That's where the fun starts. Revealing puzzle within the data is what trully fascinates me!
